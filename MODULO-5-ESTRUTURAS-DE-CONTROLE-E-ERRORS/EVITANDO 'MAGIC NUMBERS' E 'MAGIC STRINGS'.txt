There's one additional tweak you might want to make to the code.




At the moment, we always check for hard-coded string identifiers like "PAYPAL" or "CREDIT_CARD".









Hence it is a better practice to use globally defined enums - if your programming language supports that - or globally defined constants.

const TYPE_CREDIT_CARD = 'CREDIT_CARD';
// ...
if (transaction.type === TYPE_CREDIT_CARD) { ... }
By doing that, you define a value once (in a place which is easily found and editable) and you then reuse the constant / variable. Hence you can't introduce accidental typos in parts of your code and you also avoid repeating the hard-coded value over and over again. That in turn is helpful if you ever want to change the identifier => You then only need to change it once.
